This repo contains the code I produced for the course of "Condensed Matter" by Prof. Arianna Montorsi in the setting of the master in Physics of Complex Systems.

Notebooks are coded with [Marimo](https://marimo.io/). You can install it by running:
```
pip install marimo
```
and you cna use it with
```
marimo edit bosonic_ssh.py
```
if you want to be able to modify the code. If you want to use just the app you can run
```
marimo run bosonic_ssh.py
```
